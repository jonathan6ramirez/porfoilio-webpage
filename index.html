    <h3> Hi, my name is Jonathan Ramirez </h3>
    <p> I am a software developer living in Pittsburg, TX.</p>
    <p> As someone who likes to play soccer, I'm interested in:</p>
    <div class="align">
    <ul class="align">
      <li>Lining up the code and making the right plays</li>
      <li>Passing the code to someone else so they can do their own plays</li>
      <li>Getting on the field with people who are similar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> About Me </h3>
    <p> After I graduated high school, I went to college but decided that it wasn't for
      me, while attending college though I took a basic Java class. This is what sparked
      my interest in what I could do with code.
    </p>
    <p> I wasn't sure about what direction to take to get started, but ever since becoming a student at Thinkful I can see it. 
    </p>
